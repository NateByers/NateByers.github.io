I'm going to be writing about a book on probability that I'm reading. I bought 
it a while ago, but just now getting into it. The book is *Introduction to 
Probability* by Joseph Blitzstein and Jessica Hwang. Blitzstein is a professor
at Harvard and teaches a popular course on probability. This book is the text he 
uses, and his companion site for the course is stat110.net.
