`rvest` is an R package that makes it easy to scrape text from web pages. 

This code is from the [GitHub page](https://github.com/hadley/rvest) for the package. It shows
how to scrape the rating, cast, and poster for The Lego Movie from IMBD.


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(rvest)
lego_movie <- read_html("http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1490017/")

rating <- lego_movie %>% 
  html_nodes("strong span") %>%
  html_text() %>%
  as.numeric()
rating

cast <- lego_movie %>%
  html_nodes("#titleCast .itemprop span") %>%
  html_text()
cast
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Scrape the website for the url of the movie poster
poster <- lego_movie %>%
  html_nodes("#img_primary img") %>%
  html_attr("src")
poster
```

# CSS selector

The trick to all of this is the text you put in the `html_nodes` function. For example, this bit of code uses the text "#titleStoryLine p" to grab the storyline on the IMBD page.

```{r}
storyline <- lego_movie %>%
  html_nodes("#titleStoryLine p") %>%
  html_text()
cat(storyline)
```


The text "#titleStoryLine p" is a [CSS selector](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp)
that identifies the part of the page that you want to scrape. Here's a fun tutorial on how to use
selectors to grab elements on a page: http://flukeout.github.io/.

So the text "#titleStoryLine p" indicates that we selected the "p" element after the element with the id "titleStoryLine".

# SelectorGadget

But how do you know what CSS selector you should use to grab what you want on a page? Well I could just look at the text in the `lego_movie` object.

```{r}
lego_movie
```

Or I could use http://selectorgadget.com/. It's a tool for using your cursor to find the
selector you need on a webpage. To use it, drag [this link](javascript:(function(){var%20s=document.createElement('div');s.innerHTML='Loading...';s.style.color='black';s.style.padding='20px';s.style.position='fixed';s.style.zIndex='9999';s.style.fontSize='3.0em';s.style.border='2px%20solid%20black';s.style.right='40px';s.style.top='40px';s.setAttribute('class','selector_gadget_loading');s.style.background='white';document.body.appendChild(s);s=document.createElement('script');s.setAttribute('type','text/javascript');s.setAttribute('src','https://dv0akt2986vzh.cloudfront.net/unstable/lib/selectorgadget.js');document.body.appendChild(s);})();)
to your bookmark bar. Then go to IMDB, or whatever page you want to scrape, and click the
SelectorGadget bookmark. Hover over the element you want to select and click. 

In the image below, I've hovered over the Storyline paragraph and clicked.
The paragraph is green but you can see that another part of the page is
highlighted in yellow.

This means that if I use the CSS selector in the box at the bottom of the
image ("p"), I will get the Storyline and all of the other text that is
highlighted in yellow. To narrow my selection to just the Storyline, I 
click on the yellow text and exclude it from my selection.

The yellow highlight turns to red, and you can see the CSS selector
"#titleStoryLine p" in the box at the bottom of the image.
